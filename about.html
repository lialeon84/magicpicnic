            <div class="me">Hi there! Thanks for stopping by Magic Picnic. I'm Zuly; born abroad, lover of travel, and now settled down in beautiful Miami, Fl. I was always a wanderer, one who loved to escape city life at every chance; to breathe in nature's beauty while
                enjoying good company and great food. When you put that all together, it pretty much sums up what sparked my passion for offering unique and intimate picnic experiences.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="float-childs">
            <div class="me">My goal is to create something that allows people to experience nature in a seamless way, with great quality, comfort, and pleasing aesthetics. With this philosophy in mind, I founded Magic Picnic, which offers picnics with a unique bohemian
                style inspired by travel to far off places. I want to give people the opportunity to slow down, unwind, and spend quality time with the people they care about.</div>
